To keep the project looking clean I can remove having the track list on their and maybe just have a link that would show that information. Also something that would really nice that could work is sending someone to spotify or Youtube if they want to h ear the playlist of that music in order for them to get more familiar with the albumn.

As of right now im satisfied with the design and look for the albums page. Of course, I can always improve it later and add something else to make it even more fluid or make it pop somehow. I could look at some other designs and get some inspiration.

Now, I need to code my way to a better forum on the forum page. And programmatically it has to be improved as well. I haven't really dived deep into it in awhile but Im sure its not perfect as of yet.
