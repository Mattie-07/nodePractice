***TO DO LIST*****

CHECKED
The next steps that I'm going to do is make the weeknd picture a bit smaller - then I'm going to work on the next page and ensure that the other pages have the same look and feel as the front one. I can do this. Today was a great day.
CHECKED
Also I need to add this to a repo so that it could be visible.

CHECKED
I need to make sure that the page kinda looks similiar to my other one where I have one album that has a lot of info and then it changes to another background color for the next album. The code is going to be long for this one page but it will definitely be worth it.

CHECKED
The next thing that I will work on tomorrow is making sure that I can create and style a consisent button that I could use inisde of my css file. That way I can continue to use one of a couple of buttons that I created and then after that I can adjust where it is going to be and the words inside as well. 
    I would do this tonight but its going to take a little bit of time to actually decide how I want the button and position it correctly. What im going to spend the rest of the night doing it trying to get the design for the rest of the page looking more consistent by adding a bit more content.


August 5th, 2012.
    The next step is to work on the design of the chat / artwork page. I need to change the name of the forum page to artwork actually. Then I'm going to fiddle around with the design of that page until I can find something that I would like. Right now, I'm using Tumblr as a template since they have a good thing going on, and on top of that, they have a great example I could follow just by going to their website. I got this!

    I thought of a great idea! I could also put on the page, the tour dates that are upcoming for The Weeknd. I think that is something that fans would defniitley want to know!
            I need to be able to get the images like I do from the object that contains the information thats displayed on the index came. 



****LINES OF CODE***
As of the next day I have 1309 lines of code on my Weekend Project.
The goal( hopefully) is to write more and more code each day. I'm going to track how much I can get done today( a day where I am working a full shift at my job) then see where I can go from there!

***THINGS TO FIX*****
1)
CHECKED
    I would like for The Weeknd text to be on the left side of the screen. Im going to keep it where it is for right now, for the sake of progress.

CHECKED
2) What I could do it maek sure that the albums are put in different sections- like the first one woud havea black bacgkround nand the other would havea a lighter colo.




******COOL THINGS****
Things I found out that are pretty cool 
    1) I just figured out how the gird templates work a little bit more. I can add as many columns to my row as I would like and then I can specify exactly what goes in that column by specifiying that property. I could do the same for each category that I have.
